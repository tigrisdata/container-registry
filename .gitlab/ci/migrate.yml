# This pipeline is designed to verify the migration continuity between the self-managed version in the `REGISTRY_SELF_MANAGED_RELEASE_VERSION` variable and the current development version. 
# This is useful for ensuring a smooth upgrade experience between current development versions and current self-manged version. 
# While not a complete solution, this pipeline is a crucial first step in identifying potential upgrade issues, as discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1516.

# NOTE: The `REGISTRY_SELF_MANAGED_RELEASE_VERSION` must be updated manually to match the last registry version of the last GitLab release, whenever adding a new schema migration to the registry.
