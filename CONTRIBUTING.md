## Style guides

See [Go standards and style guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/go_guide),
and the project specific [style guidelines](./docs/style-guide.md).

## Commits

In this project we value good commit hygiene. Clean commits makes it much
easier to discover when bugs have been introduced, why changes have been made,
and what their reasoning was.

When you submit a merge request, expect the changes to be reviewed
commit-by-commit. To make it easier for the reviewer, please submit your MR
with nicely formatted commit messages and changes tied together step-by-step.

### Write small, atomic commits

Commits should be as small as possible but not smaller than required to make a
logically complete change. If you struggle to find a proper summary for your
commit message, it's a good indicator that the changes you make in this commit may
not be focused enough.

`git add -p` is useful to add only relevant changes. Often you only notice that
you require additional changes to achieve your goal when halfway through the
implementation. Use `git stash` to help you stay focused on this additional
change until you have implemented it in a separate commit.

### Split up refactors and behavioral changes

Introducing changes in behavior very often requires preliminary refactors. You
should never squash refactoring and behavioral changes into a single commit,
because that makes it very hard to spot the actual change later.

### Tell a story

When splitting up commits into small and logical changes, there will be many
interdependencies between all commits of your feature branch. If you make
changes to simply prepare another change, you should briefly mention the overall
goal that this commit is heading towards.

### Describe why you make changes, not what you change

When writing commit messages, you should typically explain why a given change is
being made. For example, if you have pondered several potential solutions, you
can explain why you settled on the specific implementation you chose. What has
changed is typically visible from the diff itself.

A good commit message answers the following questions:

- What is the current situation?
- Why does that situation need to change?
- How does your change fix that situation?
- Are there relevant resources which help further the understanding? If so,
  provide references.

You may want to set up a [message template](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/better-commit-messages-with-a-gitmessage-template)
to pre-populate your editor when executing `git commit`.

### Message format

Commit messages must be:

- Formatted following the
  [Conventional Commits 1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  specification;

- Be all lower case, except for acronyms and source code identifiers;

- For localized changes, have the affected package in the scope portion, minus
  the root package prefix (`registry/`). For changes affecting multiple
  packages, use the parent package name that is common to all, unless it's the
  root one;

- Use one of the commit types defined in the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#type);

- For dependencies, use `build` type and `deps` scope. Include the module name
  and the target version if upgrading or adding a dependency;

- End with ` (<issue reference>)` if the commit is fixing an issue;

- Subjects shouldn't exceed 72 characters.

#### Examples

```plaintext
build(deps): upgrade cloud.google.com/go/storage to v1.16.0
```

```plaintext
fix(handlers): handle manifest not found errors gracefully (#12345)
```

```plaintext
perf(storage/driver/gcs): improve blob upload performance
```

### Mention the original commit that introduced bugs

When implementing bugfixes, it's often useful information to see why a bug was
introduced and when it was introduced. Therefore, mentioning the original commit
that introduced a given bug is recommended. You can use `git blame` or `git
bisect` to help you identify that commit.

The format used to mention commits is typically the abbreviated object ID
followed by the commit subject and the commit date. You may create an alias for
this to have it easily available. For example:

```shell
$ git config alias.reference "show -s --pretty=reference"
$ git reference HEAD
cf7f9ffe5 (style: Document best practices for commit hygiene, 2020-11-20)
```

### Use interactive rebases to arrange your commit series

Use interactive rebases to end up with commit series that are readable and
therefore also easily reviewable one-by-one. Use interactive rebases to
rearrange commits, improve their commit messages, or squash multiple commits
into one.

### Create fixup commits

When you create multiple commits as part of feature branches, you
frequently discover bugs in one of the commits you've just written. Instead of
creating a separate commit, you can easily create a fixup commit and squash it
directly into the original source of bugs via `git commit --fixup=ORIG_COMMIT`
and `git rebase --interactive --autosquash`.

### Avoid merge commits

During development other changes might be made to the target branch. These
changes might cause a conflict with your changes. Instead of merging the target
branch into your topic branch, rebase your branch onto the target
branch. Consider setting up `git rerere` to avoid resolving the same conflict
over and over again.

### Ensure that all commits build and pass tests

To keep history bisectable using `git bisect`, you should ensure that all of
your commits build and pass tests.

### Example

A great commit message could look something like:

```plaintext
fix(package): summarize change in 50 characters or less (#123)

The first line of the commit message is the summary. The summary should
start with a capital letter and not end with a period. Optionally
prepend the summary with the package name, feature, file, or piece of
the codebase where the change belongs to.

After an empty line the commit body provides a more detailed explanatory
text. This body is wrapped at 72 characters. The body can consist of
several paragraphs, each separated with a blank line.

The body explains the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why
you are making this change as opposed to what (the code explains this).
Are there side effects or other counterintuitive consequences of
this change? Here's the place to explain them.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between

- Use a hanging indent

These guidelines are pretty similar to those described in the Git Book
[1]. If you like you can use footnotes to include a lengthy hyperlink
that would otherwise clutter the text.

You can provide links to the related issue, or the issue that's fixed by
the change at the bottom using a trailer. A trailer is a token, without
spaces, directly followed with a colon and a value. Order of trailers
doesn't matter.

## Changelog

The [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) is automatically generated using
[semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) when
a new tag is pushed.

## Maintainers and reviewers

The list of project maintainers and reviewers can be found
[here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/projects/#container-registry).

Maintainers can be pinged using `@gitlab-org/maintainers/container-registry`.

## Review Process

Merge requests need **approval by at least two** members, including at least one
[maintainer](#maintainers-and-reviewers).

We use the [reviewer roulette](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#reviewer-roulette)
to identify available reviewers and maintainers for every open merge request.
Feel free to override these selections if you think someone else would be
better-suited to review your change.

## Releases

We use [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
to generate changelog entries and new git tags.

### Release workflow

To add review gates and avoid direct pushes to `master`, releases are prepared on a temporary release branch via CI and merged through a Merge Request (MR):

1. A maintainer triggers the `release:prepare` job in the `release` stage on the `master` branch.
2. The job creates a temporary branch `release/vX.Y.Z` from `master`, updates `CHANGELOG.md`,
   pushes the branch, and opens an MR targeting `master`.
3. Maintainers review and approve the MR. Standard approvals apply.
4. After the MR is merged into `master`, the `release:tag` job detects the updated `CHANGELOG.md`,
   creates the annotated tag (`vX.Y.Z-gitlab`), and pushes it.
5. The existing `publish` and downstream release jobs are then available against the new tag.

Notes:

- If no new version is computed (no conventional commits since last release), the prepare job exits without changes.

- The MR is set to remove the source branch on merge.

Required CI variables for automation:

- `RELEASE_TOKEN` (api + write_repository) used to push release branches, open MRs, and create tags.

- Configure Protected Branches to allow the token’s user to push `release/*`.

- Configure Protected Tags to allow the token’s user to create `v*-gitlab`.

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` remains used by publish flow.

### Patch a release

Use the manual CI job `release:backport` to create a patch release on a maintenance line without pushing to the default branch.

- Prerequisites
  - The fix is already merged into the default branch; collect its commit SHA(s).

- Run the job
  - Trigger `release:backport` and set:
    - `BASE_TAG`: base release tag to branch from, for example `v4.13.0-gitlab`
    - `NEW_VERSION`: target version without the “v”, for example `4.13.1`
    - `CHERRY_PICK_SHAS`: one or more SHAs, separated by spaces/commas/newlines
    - Optional `BRANCH_NAME`: defaults to `release/v<NEW_VERSION>`
  - The job will:
    - Create the branch from `BASE_TAG` and cherry‑pick the SHAs
    - Regenerate `CHANGELOG.md`
    - Commit `chore(release): <NEW_VERSION>`
    - Push the branch and create the tag `v<NEW_VERSION>-gitlab`
  - The tag pipeline publishes the release.

- Conflict recovery
  - If a cherry‑pick conflicts, the job aborts, pushes `BRANCH_NAME`, and exits with instructions.
  - Resolve conflicts locally on `BRANCH_NAME`, push, then rerun `release:backport` with the same `NEW_VERSION` and `RESUME=true`.

### Legacy local flow (fallback)

If the MR-based flow proves too disruptive, maintainers can temporarily revert to the previous process:

1. Run `make dev-tools` once to install local dependencies.
2. Preview with `make release-dry-run`.
3. Create a release with `make release` (commits changelog and pushes tag).

This legacy path still respects semantic-release rules but bypasses the MR gate.

## Golang Version Support

Please see [Supporting multiple Go versions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/go_guide/go_upgrade.html#supporting-multiple-go-versions).

Support for individual versions is ensured via the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the
root of this repository. If you modify this file to add additional jobs, please
ensure that those jobs run against all supported versions.

## Development Process

We follow the engineering process as described in the
[handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/),
with the exception that our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/issues/) is
on the Container Registry project.

You can find some technical documentation inherited from the upstream Docker
Distribution Registry under [`docs`](docs), namely:

- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) - We keep a local copy of this file
  because we extended the [upstream](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/about/configuration/)
  version with additional configuration settings over time.
- [Docker Registry HTTP API V2](docs/spec/docker/v2/api.md) - We keep a local 
  copy of this spec because we had the need to extend the
  [upstream](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/api/)
  functionality.

When making changes to the HTTP API V2 or application configuration, please
make sure to always update the respective documentation linked above.

Apart from the above, you can find the following technical documentation
